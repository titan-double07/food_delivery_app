## Auth Funtionality

-  create a function that creates a new user account, their session and also stores them within the database as soon as they create an account. 

### to do this 
- create a new app router client and configuration
```tsx
// in the appwrite file in lib folder
export const client = new Appwrite();
client
  .setEndpoint()
  .setProject()
  .setPlatform();

```


- set up different appwrite functionalities

```tsx
// in the appwrite file in lib folder
export const account = new Account(client);
export const database = new Databases(client);
export const avatars= new Avatars(client);
```

- define create user function as well  as signin function

```tsx
// in the appwrite file in lib folder
export const createUser = async ({email, password, name}:CreateUserParams) => {
  try {
    const newAccount = await account.create(userId:ID.unique(), email:email, password:password, name:name);
    if(!newAccount) throw new Error("Failed to create user");

    await signInUser(email, password);

    const avatarUrl = await avatars.getInitialsURL(name); // used by appwrite to create an avatar for the user using their name

    const newUser = await database.createDocument(
      databaseId, // in config
      collectionId, //inn sonfig
      ID.unique(),
      data:{
        accountId: newAccount.$id, 
        name,
        email,
        avatarUrl,
      }
    )
    
  }catch(error) {
    throw new Error(error);
  }

};

export const signInUser = async (email: string, password: string) => {
  try {
    // create a session
    const session = await account.createEmailPasswordSession(email, password);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(error);
  }
};
```

- in the signup screen call the create user function
  - for the function to work you might need to enable permissions in appwrite

- in the login screen call the sign in function

- in the appwrite file in lib folder, write a function to get the details of the logged in user
  - save the user details in a global state

### Note you need to eneble the permissions on the database in your appwrite dashboard

- use a share state (Zustand store) to store the user authenticatied state
in Auth store
  - isAuthenticated : boolean
  - user : User
  - isLoading : boolean
  - setIsAuthenticated : (isAuthenticated: boolean) => void
  - setUser : (user: User) => void
  - setIsLoading : (isLoading: boolean) => void
  - fetchAuthenticatedUser: () => Promise<void>

  - in the root of the app get the isLoading and fetchAuthenticatedUser from the store,
  use a useEffect to call the function and return null if  fontsLoaded and isLoading is false

  - in AuthLLayout redirect to the home page if the user is authenticated (get from store)

## Tab Navigation

AIM: to create a bottom tab navigation with 4 tabs (home, search, cart, profile)

- To crete the tabs navigation
  - use the Tabs.Screen component from expo-router, and include the props
    - name : string
    - options : object
      - title : string
      - tabBarIcon : ({color, size}) => React.ReactNode (Crete a custom TabBarIcon component that takes in focused, icon, title )
      used the focused state to set tint color;
      render the icon using image component and the title using text component
Caveat: the tabs would display both custom component (icon and title) but the default text would still be there
  - to remove the default text use in the <Tabs> component set the screenOptions = {{tabBarShowLabel: false, headerShown: false }}

- to style the tab bar
  - use the screenOptions prop in the <Tabs> component
  - set the tabBarStyle : {position: 'absolute', bottom: 10, left: 10, right: 10, elevation: 0, backgroundColor: 'white', borderRadius: 15, height: 60, ...styles.shadow}
  - create a shadow style in a styles object
 

```tsx
//in the (tabs) _layout.tsx folder 
<Tabs>

</Tabs>

```

## Database Architecture 

- when thinking/designing the database architecture, think in terms of a real restaurant or how similar apps work, think of the entities and their relationships, for example in a food delivery app, you would have the following entities
  - users
  - restaurants
  - menu items
  - orders
  - reviews
  - categories
  - cart
  - payments

- in Appwrite dashboard, databases (allow permissions for USers) and add each collections id to the config file in lib folder
  - create a new collection for categories, fields: 
    - name (string,size:100, required: true), description (string, size: 500, required: false)

  - create a new collection for menu, fields:
    - name (string,size:100, required: true), 
    description (string, size: 2000, required: truee), 
    imageUrl (URL, required: false), 
    price (float, min: 1, max: 10000, required: true), 
    rating (float, min: 1, max: 5 , required: true), 
    calories (integer, min: 1, max: 1000, required: true),
    protein (integer, min: 1, max: 1000, required: true),
    - we then need to create a two way relationship between menu and categories, the relation would be many to one,ie menu can belong to one category, but a category can have many menu items

  - Since most food items come with optional choices like extra cheese, fries, coke etc, we need to create a new collection for customizations, fields:
    - name (type:string,size:100, required: true),
    price (float, min: 1, max: 10000, required: true),
    type (enum, options: ['topping', 'side', 'drink', 'sauce'], required: true)

  - We now have to take note of the relationship between menu and customizations, the relationship would be many to many, ie a menu item can have many customizations, and a customization can belong to many menu items
    - to achieve this we would create a new collection called menu_customizations that will contain a pair of references , fields:
      - 2 way relationship btw menu and menu_customizations (many to one, ie a menu can have many menu_customizations, but a menu_customization belongs to one menu item)
      - 2 way relationship btw customizations and menu_customizations (one to many, ie a customization can have many menu_customizations, but a menu_customization belongs to one customization)


## Seeding A Database

 when setting up a new project, it is important to have some data in the database to test the app, this is where seeding a database comes in handy, seeding a database is the process of adding initial data to the database, this can be done manually by adding data to the database via the appwrite dashboard, or programmatically by writing a script that adds data to the database 

#### From video
- create a new file called data.ts in the lib folder, to contain the seed data (dummy data)
- create a new file called seed.ts in the lib folder, to contain the seeding logic (check tool kit )
  -  the seed file would be interating with the appwrite store to upload the images, so we need to add the definition for the storage in the appwrite file in lib folder (new Storage(client))


# Search Screen
AIM: to deevelop the search screen and display the search results

First we want to write a function to get all the menu items with a search by text and filter by category.

- to do that with Appwrite, we would need to specify the kind of search you want to do, Either it's a full text or its unique ie INDEXING

In Appwrite dashboard => menu collection => indexes => create index
- name it index_1 => type: full_text => field: name in asc

in the appwrite file in lib folder, create a new function getMenu

```tsx

export const getMenu = async ({ category, query }: GetMenuParams) => {
    try {
        const queries: string[] = [];

        if(category) queries.push(Query.equal('categories', category));
        if(query) queries.push(Query.search('name', query));

        const menus = await databases.listDocuments(
            appwriteConfig.databaseId,
            appwriteConfig.menuCollectionId,
            queries,
        )

        return menus.documents;
    } catch (e) {
        throw new Error(e as string);
    }
}


export const getCategories = async () => {
    try {
        const categories = await databases.listDocuments(
            appwriteConfig.databaseId,
            appwriteConfig.categoriesCollectionId,
        )

        return categories.documents;
    } catch (e) {
        throw new Error(e as string);
    }
}
```

- we can then create a reuseable function we'll use to call these functions, useAppWrite.tsx (refer to the github repo for the full code)
```tsx
const {data , isLoading, error, refetch} = useAppWrite(
  {
    fn: getMenu,
    params: {category: "", query: "", limit:6 }

  }
)

```

In the search file, 
- fetch menu and categories using the useAppWrite hook, for the categories fetch we wouldnt need any params ( it doesnt aceept any)
 - to get the query or category we make use of useLocalSearchParams from expo-router
 - also define a useEffect that would call the refetch function whenever the query or category changes

Now the UI 

- we'll make use of a flat list
  - rendeItem to render each menu item (MenuCard component)
  - ListHeaderComponent to render the header (search bar and categories)
  - numColumns to  set the number of columns 
  - columnWrapperStyle / className to style the columns
  - contentContainerStyle / className to style the content container

to get the staggered list effect, we would use the index of the item to determine the marginTop of the item
  - if the index is even, we set the marginTop to  0, if the index is odd, we set the marginTop to 20

- create a MenuCard component with the prop type MenuItem
  - to read images from appwrite, we need the image_url and the projectId i.e 
  ```tsx
const imageUrl = `${menu.imageUrl}?project=${appwriteConfig.projectId}`;

  ```
